  You have learned about how the author<br>
  used diagrams in Our World in Space:<br>
  Planets. You made a diagram of the<br>
  solar system, and labeled its planets.<br><br>
  
  Now, you’ll look at details about the<br>
  planets. Then, you will begin planning<br>
  your own planet book.<br><br>
  
  First, turn to pp. 40–47 of <a href="https://lti-pip.savvasrealize.com/community/lti/content/36ce8d20-72af-38d7-bb39-df1f0b968a9b/0" class="blue"> World in<br>
  Space: Planets</a>, in the Text Collection,<br>
  Unit 5.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  
  In the text, find the phrase "float away." A phrase is a group of words that cannot be a full sentence. You can use a <a href="https://coursecontent.calvertlearning.com/M2018G3ENGLL008P/M2018G3ENGLL008PT005/GO_Web%204%20ovals.pdf" class="blue">Web Graphic<br>
  Organizer</a> to help you figure out the meaning of phrases.
  
  The author of Our World in Space: Planets wrote about our solar system. She answered questions about the planets in the book.<br>
  Now, you will write questions to answer in your own book about a planet. You can use a <a href="https://coursecontent.calvertlearning.com/M2018G3ENGLL003P/M2018G3ENGLL003PT002/G3_ELA_GO_T-Chart_Blank.pdf" class="blue;">T-Chart</a> to write down the questions and<br>
  answers.<br><br>
  
  Choose one planet. Talk with your Learning Guide about questions you have about this planet.
  
  In this lesson, you learned how to use text features to find information. Knowing where to look for information will make you a better reader. You also started planning your own planet book by asking questions. Next, you’ll research the answers to those questions.
  
  You used a Word Web to show information about a phrase or idea. Now you will use a Word Web to show ways the oceans on Earth and the moon are different.
  
  Begin by reading pp. 13–14 of Let's Visit the Moon found in Unit 5 of the Text Collection. Use the table of contents in the top right corner to help you find the correct text. Read to notice how oceans on Earth and the moon are different. Use a Web Graphic Organizer to make a Word Web. Write "oceans" in the center and add other words to show these differences.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  Birgit, you did great work on the assessment. You have provided a few differences between oceans on the Earth and the Moon. Also, you have included a few more differences. Good job!

  Did you:
  
  Create a Word Web with "oceans" in the center?
  Write at least four differences you learned from reading the text that show how the oceans on the Earth and moon are different?
