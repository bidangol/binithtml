    I can read in <span style="color:red;">red.</span> I can read in <span style="color:blue;">blue.</span> I can read in <span style="color:green;">pickle color</span> too.

    <br><br>I can read in bed. And in <span style="color :violet">purple.</span> And in <span style="color:brown">brown.</span> I can read in a circle and upside down!<br><br>
    
    I can read with my <abbr title="image showing fish">left eye.</abbr> I can read with my <abbr title="image showing another fish">right eye.</abbr> I can read Mississippi with my eye's <abbr title="image showing Mississippi">shut tight!</abbr>

    <br><br>I can read them with my <abbr title="image showing  Mississippi, Indianapolis and Hallelujah, too!">eyes shut!</abbr> It is VERY HARD to do!<br><br>

    But it's bad for my hat and makes my eyebrows red hot. SO... reading with my eye's shut I don't do an awful lot.<br><br>

    And when I keep them open I can read much more speed. You have to be a speedy reader 'cause there's so, so much to read!<br><br> You can read about trees... and bees... and knees. And knees on trees! And bees on threes!

    <br><br>You can read about anchors. And all about ants. You can read about ankles. And crocodile pants!<br> <br>You can read about hoses... and how to smell roses... and what should you do about owls on noses!

    <br><br>Young cat! If keep your eye's open enough oh, the stuff you will learn! The most wonderful stuff! You'll learn about...<br><br>

    fishbones... and wish bones. You'll learn about trombones, too. You'll learn about Jake the Pillow Snake and all about Foo-Foo Snoo.<br><br>
    
    You can learn about ice. You can learn about mice. Mice on ice. And ice on mice. You can learn about the price on ice. Nice ice for sale. Ten cents a pail.<br><br>

    You can learn about SAD... and GLAD... and MAD! There are so many things you can learn about. BUT... you'll miss the best things if you keep your eyes shut.<br> <br>
    
    The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. <br><br>You might learn a way to earn a few dollars. Or how to make doughnuts... or Kangaroo collars.<br> <br>

    You can learn to read music and play a Hut-Zut if you keep your eyes open. But <u>not</u> with them shut.<br><br>If you read your eyes shut your likely to find tht the place where going is far, far behind.<br> <br>

    SO... that's why I tell you to keep your eyes wide. Keep them wide open... at least on one side.<br><br>

    <h2>The Cat in the Hat Comes back</h2>

    This was no time for play. This was no time for fun. This was no time for games. There was work to be done.<br><br>

    All that deep, Deep, deep, snow. All that snow had to go. When our mother went down to the town for that day, she said,"sombody has to clean this snow away. Somebody, SOMEBODY has to, you see. Then she picked two somebodies Sally and me.<br><br>
    
    Well.. There we were. We were working like that. Then who should come up. But the CAT IN THE HAT! "Oh-oh" Sally said. "Don't you talk to that cat. That cat is a bad one, that Cat in the Hat. He play's lots of bad tricks. Don't you let him near. You know what he did last time he was here."

    <br><br>"Play tricks?" laughed the cat "Oh, my my! No, no, no! I just want to go in to get out of the snow. Keep your mind on your work. You just stay there, you two. I will go in the house and find something to do." Then that cat went right in! That cat was up to no good! So I ran in after as fast as I could!
    
    <br><br>Do you know where I found him? You know where he was? He was eating cake in the tub! Yes he was! The hot water was on. And the cold water, too. And I said to the cat, "what a bad thing to do!" "But I like to eat cake in tub," laughed the cat. "You should try it sometime," laughed the cat as he sat.
    
    <br><br>And then I got mad. This was no time for play. I said, "Cat! You get out! There is work to be done. I have no time for tricks. I must go back and dig. I can't have you in here eating cake like a pig! You get out of this house! We don't want you in about!" Then I shut off the water and let it run out.

    <br><br>The water ran out. Then I SAW THE RING! A ring in a tub! And, oh boy! What a thing! A big long pink cat ring! It looked like pink ink! And I said,"will this ever come off? I don't think!"<br><br>
    
    "Have no fear with that ring." Laughed the Cat the cat in the Hat. "Why, I can take cat rings off tubs. Just like that!" Do you know how he did it? WITH MOTHERS WHITE DRESS! Now the tub was all clean, but her dress it was a mess!

    <br><br>Then Sally loked in. Sally saw the dress, too! And Sally and I did not know what to do. We should work in the snow. But that dress! What a spot! "It may never come off!" Sally said. "It may not!"<br><br>
s
    But the cat laughed,"Ho! Ho!. I can make the spot go. The way I take spots off a dress is just so!" "See here!" laughed the cat. "It is not hard at all. The thing that takes out spots off a dress is a wall!" Then we saw the cat wipe the spot of the dress. Now the dress was all clean. But the wall! What a mess!

    <br><br>"Oh, wall spots!" he laughed. "Let me tell you some news. To take spots off a wall, is two shoes!" Whose shoes did he use? I looked and saw whose! And I said to the cat,"this is very bad news. Now the spot is all over DAD'S $10 DOLLAR SHOES!"<br><br>

    "But your dad will not know about that,"said the cat. ""He will never find out,"laughed the Cat in the Hat"His $10 shoes will have no spots at all I will rub them right off on this rug in the hall." "But now we have rug spots!" I yelled "what a day! Rug spots! What next? Can you take THEM away?"

    <br><br>"Don't ask me," he laughed. "Why, you know that I can!" Then he picked up the rug and away the cat rain. "I can clean up these rug spots before you count three! No spots are too hard for a cat like me!"<br><br>
    
    He ran into dad's bedroom and then the cat said, "it is good that your dad has the right king of bed." Then he shook the rug! CRACK! Now the bed had the spots! And all I could say was, now what  cat? NOW what?<br><br>

    But the cat just stood still. He just looked at the bed.
